# My .vimrc

## Usage

Install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) first, and then clone my .vimrc and auxiliary files:

```
git clone git@github.com:daquexian/.vimrc ~/vimrc
ln -s ~/vimrc/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
```

For YouCompleteMe, please make sure [dependencies](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe#installation) are installed. (Just make sure the dependencies existing, you don't need to run install.py by yourself)

Then start Vim, run `:PlugInstall`, and everything including YouCompleteMe will be ready.
